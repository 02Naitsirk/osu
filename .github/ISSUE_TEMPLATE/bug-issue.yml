        ## Logs

        Attaching log files is required for every reported bug. Instructions how to find the log files are listed below.

        If the game has not yet been closed since you found the bug:
          1. Head on to game settings and click on "Open osu! folder"
          2. Then open the `logs` folder located there

        If the game crashed or has been closed since you found the bug, **do not** restart the game to retrieve the logs as they will reset. You must find them using the file explorer.

        By default logs can be found in:
          - `%AppData%/osu/logs` *(on Windows),*
          - `~/.local/share/osu/logs` *(on Linux & macOS).*
          - `Android/data/sh.ppy.osulazer/files/logs` *(on Android)*,
          - on iOS they can be obtained by connecting your device to your desktop and copying the `logs` directory from the app's own document storage using iTunes. (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201301#copy-to-computer)

        However, if you have selected a custom location for the game files via settings, you must find that custom folder and open the `logs` folder there.

        After locating the `logs` folder, select all log files inside and drag them into the "Logs" box below.
