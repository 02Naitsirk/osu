        ## Logs attachments

        Logs are necessary to further investigate this bug. They are reset every new game session, so you need to ensure the logs are preserved by not starting/restarting osu! after encountering the bug.

        In the case this isn't a "Crash to Desktop" report, to retrieve logs:
          1. Head on to game settings and click on "Open osu! folder"
          2. Then open the `logs` folder located there

        Otherwise, logs can *only* be retrieved via file explorer, as running the game will reset them.

        Logs are, by default, located at:
          - `%AppData%/osu/logs` *(on Windows),*
          - `~/.local/share/osu/logs` *(on Linux & macOS).*
          - `Android/data/sh.ppy.osulazer/files/logs` *(on Android)*,
          - on iOS they can be obtained by connecting your device to your desktop and copying the `logs` directory from the app's own document storage using iTunes. (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201301#copy-to-computer)

        If you have relocated your game folder, head into that location and open the `logs` folder.

        Finally, select all log files and drag them into the "Logs" box below.
